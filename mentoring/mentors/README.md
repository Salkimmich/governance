# Confidential Computing Consortium Mentorship Program Guide

Welcome to the Confidential Computing Consortium (CCC) Mentorship Program! This initiative is dedicated to advancing the field of confidential computing through collaborative innovation and skill development. By participating in this program, mentors and mentees work together on CCC projects, driving forward the capabilities of confidential computing technologies.

## Why Become a Mentor?

Mentorship within the CCC offers a unique opportunity to contribute to the cutting-edge field of confidential computing. It's a chance to give back to the community, support emerging talents, and foster the next generation of technology leaders. Mentoring allows you to:

- Share your knowledge and expertise in confidential computing.
- Enhance your own skills and understanding of new advancements.
- Leverage mentees to help augment the existing project communityâ€™s resources and efforts
- Help shape the future of secure computing by guiding innovative projects to success.

Mentoring is not just about guiding others; it's a reciprocal relationship that offers growth, learning opportunities, and the satisfaction of contributing to meaningful advancements in confidential computing.

## Expectations from Mentors

Mentors in the CCC Mentorship Program are expected to:

- Identify and propose project ideas that push the envelope in confidential computing.
- Select mentees and guide them through the proposal process, ensuring alignment with project goals.
- Provide continuous support, guidance, and feedback to mentees throughout the program.
- Facilitate mentees' integration into the CCC community, encouraging contributions to code, documentation, and community discussions.
- Assist mentees in developing both technical skills and soft skills, such as effective communication and time management.

Mentors are anticipated to dedicate approximately 3-6 hours per week per mentee, which includes project oversight, communication, and feedback sessions.

## How to Become a Mentor?

Becoming a mentor in the CCC Mentorship Program involves a few key steps:

1. **Stay Informed:** Watch for announcements about mentorship opportunities on CCC communication channels, such as the [CCC Slack](confidentialcomputing.slack.com) workspace and mailing lists.
2. **Propose a Project:** Whether you have a new idea or want to mentor for an existing project, submit your proposal using the [CCC's project idea template](mentoring/PROJECT_IDEA_TEMPLATE.md) as a Pull Request in the CCC mentoring repo.
3. **Review Applications:** Evaluate proposals from potential mentees, selecting those that best match the project's objectives and the mentee's capabilities.
4. **Begin Mentoring:** Once mentees are selected, kick off the mentorship by establishing goals, milestones, and regular check-in schedules.
